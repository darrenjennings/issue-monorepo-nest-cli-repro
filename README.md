# Reproduction

1. create new monorepo nest app

```sh
nest new monorepo-repro-build
cd monorepo-repro-build
yarn nest generate app new-one
yarn nest generate lib my-lib
# > specify @lib
```

2. update nest-cli.json:
   1. `webpack: false`
3. update tsconfig.json to have `@apps/` path
4. run `yarn build`
5. run `yarn start:dev new-one` <-- runs correctly
6. run `yarn start:prod` <-- only runs monorepo-repro-build
7. update `new-one/src/main.ts` to include file from monorepo-repro-build
   1. code currently commented out in this repo. Uncomment to see issue
  
Questions:

1. How to start prod of `new-one` consistently? If the uncommented code is add (Step 7) then, `yarn start:dev new-one` fails because `main.js` has been moved
2. How to start:dev of any service consistently?
